    <p>
      These is an easy, cost-efficient way to make home-made fried cheese
      sticks. Taste just wonderful, light crispiness. More for your dollar and
      easily stored in the freezer for when you have a craving. I make 2
      batches, one for the 'now' and one for later. Serve with your favorite
      dipping sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>24 (1 ounce) sticks string cheese</li>
      <li>5 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>3 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove string cheese sticks from plastic wrappings and cut the strings
        in half crosswise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place eggs in a bowl and bread
        crumbs into a large shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip cheese stick halves into egg and roll in bread crumbs to completely
        coat the sticks; place breaded cheese sticks onto the prepared baking
        sheet. Allow cheese sticks to stand at room temperature for about 5
        minutes to set, and repeat dipping in egg and bread crumbs to form a
        thick coating. Freeze breaded cheese sticks for at least 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep fry cheese sticks, a few at a time, until the coating is golden
        brown and crisp and the cheese is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Let sticks drain
        on paper towels; cool slightly and serve warm.
      </li>
